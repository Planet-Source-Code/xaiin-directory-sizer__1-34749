### Description

Suffering with the problem of lack of disk space I knew there must be a directory on my hard disk that contained a lot of information, this is why I wrote this application. Its simple in what it does but can provide useful information about your hard disk space. It allows you to select a drive and then by using a tree control lets you navigate through it displaying hard disk usage for each folder it sees..
 
### More Info
 
A Drive control is used to get the required drive you wish to scan.

Very straight forward.

Displays hard disk usage in a tree view.

None that I know of!
